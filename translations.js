        faq_esign_subtitle: "Common questions about Encrypted eSign.",
        faq_esign_q1: "Is encrypted eSign legally valid?",
        faq_esign_a1: "Yes. The signature records provide stronger evidentiary support than standard electronic approval logs because the document integrity and signing event can be independently verified.",
        faq_esign_q2: "Can a signed document be edited later?",
        faq_esign_a2: "It can be edited, but the change will be immediately detectable and provable. The cryptographic seal ensures any modification breaks the signature's validity.",
        faq_esign_q3: "Do signers need technical knowledge?",
        faq_esign_a3: "No, the signing experience remains simple — encryption operates in the background. Users sign visually as they always have, while the platform handles the cryptography.",
        faq_esign_q4: "What happens if we stop using BrillSign?",
        faq_esign_a4: "Your signed documents remain verifiable without the platform. The proofs are embedded in the document or blockchain record, ensuring long-term independence.",
        faq_esign_q5: "Is this the same as a digital signature certificate?",
        faq_esign_a5: "Not exactly. Certificates verify identity. Encrypted eSign verifies the entire signing event — document, intent, and time — creating a complete, tamper-proof record.",
